- The number of hits it takesk to destroy a brick is displayed on each brick.
- Green balls are also created along with the bricks, and give the user more balls to launch.

- The board contains a set of bricks, and the bricks are placed randomly and can be adjacent to one another. 
- Balls are given to the users, and the users can aim the ball to hit bricks and break them. 
- Bricks can take multiple hits to be broken. 
- Balls can bounce off walls, but once one ball hits the floor in a specific point, that point will the the starting point for the next launch. 
- The movement of the balls are based off vector functions, which calculate their trajectory using pixels.
