# Brick Breaker

## Presents

- The board is created and the user is given one ball and a collection of bricks is displayed on the board. 
- The user can change the difficulty to increase the number of hits it takes to break a brick, and the number of balls they recieve. 
- The user can aim the launcher and shoot the ball in the direction specified by their input. 
- Their collection of balls is visible, so they know how many balls they have, and what kinds of balls they have. 

## Description

- The board contains a set of bricks, and the bricks are placed randomly and can be adjacent to one another. 
- Balls are given to the users, and the users can aim the ball to hit bricks and break them. 
- Some bricks may take more than one hit to break, or more powerful balls to break in one hit. 
- Balls can bounce off walls, but once one ball hits the floor in a specific point, that point will the the starting point for the next launch. 
- The movement of the balls are based off vector functions, which calculate their trajectory using pixels. 
- Bricks that have the same color and are adjacent to one another may all be broken if one of them is hit by a ball. Some bricks may release powerup balls, which will be added to the players collection for use in the next round. 
- Once all the balls are cleared on a board, then the player proceeds to the next round, and more bricks appear and they are given more balls. 
- The difficulty setting can control the amount of bricks, the  amount of hits it takes to break bricks, and the number of balls a player is given.
