- Crucial Jobs:

- - Creating algorithms for how the balls will move
- - - What direction the ball moves in
- - - Ball interaction with the wall (bouncing)
- - - Ball interaction with the floor (sticking)
- - - Releasing chain of balls 
- - - Special balls (powerups)

- - Creating algorithms for how the blocks will interact with balls
- - - Block being broken when hit by a ball

- - Finishing the necessary classes
- - - Ball
- - - Board
- - - Brick
- - - BrickBreaker
- - - Launcher

- Core Components:

- - Incorporate linked lists into the board
- - - blocks will be linked to four directions, up down left and right
- - - blocks linked to blocks with the same color attribute will destroy the linked one. All adjacent blocks of same color will be destroyed if one of them is hit

- - Incorporate a stack into the collection of balls
- - - Determine which ball to release, how many balls you have in total
- - Establish the interaction between blocks and balls, and blocks and other blocks
- - - Balls destroy blocks on contact
- - - Blocks connected to a block of the same color being destroyed will be destroyed

- Pre-Requisites:
- - Pre-Requisites should be created and completed already (All the classes which are reliant on eachother)

- Collaboration Goals:
- - Most of the components should be done as a group, since all classes are linked in one way or another.

- Timeline:
- - Basic structure of the program should be completed with classes connected to one another
- - Ball movement Algorithms should be fully developed and working by 2018-06-06
- - Block interaction should be completed and working by the end of 2018=06=06
- - Full program should be completed by 2018-06-07
- - Gives leeway for polishing up program on 2018-06-08 or solving any issues that occurred.
