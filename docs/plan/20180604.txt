- Crucial Jobs:
- - Creating algorithms for how the balls will move
- - Creating algorithms for how the blocks will interact with balls
- - Finishing the necessary classes

- Core Components:
- - Incorporate linked lists into the board
- - Incorporate a stack into the collection of balls
- - Establish the interaction between blocks and balls, and blocks and other blocks

- Pre-Requisites
- - Pre-Requisites should be created and completed already

- Collaboration Goals:
- - Most of the components should be done as a group, since all classes are linked in one way or another.

- Timeline:
- - Basic structure of the program should be completed with classes connected to one another
- - Algorithms should be fully developed and working by 2018-06-06
- - Full program should be completed by 2018-06-07
